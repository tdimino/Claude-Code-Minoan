Title: Connect Claude Code to tools via MCP - Claude Docs

URL Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp

Markdown Content:
Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs.

What you can do with MCP
------------------------

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

*   **Implement features from issue trackers**: “Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub.”
*   **Analyze monitoring data**: “Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521.”
*   **Query databases**: “Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our Postgres database.”
*   **Integrate designs**: “Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack”
*   **Automate workflows**: “Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature.”

Installing MCP servers
----------------------

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

### Option 1: Add a remote HTTP server

HTTP servers are the recommended option for connecting to remote MCP servers. This is the most widely supported transport for cloud-based services.

```
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Option 2: Add a remote SSE server

```
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Asana
claude mcp add --transport sse asana https://mcp.asana.com/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/sse \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
```

### Option 3: Add a local stdio server

Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They’re ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.

```
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport stdio <name> <command> [args...]

# Real example: Add Airtable server
claude mcp add --transport stdio airtable --env AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -- npx -y airtable-mcp-server
```

### Managing your servers

Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:

```
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove github

# (within Claude Code) Check server status
/mcp
```

### Plugin-provided MCP servers

[Plugins](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) can bundle MCP servers, automatically providing tools and integrations when the plugin is enabled. Plugin MCP servers work identically to user-configured servers.**How plugin MCP servers work**:

*   Plugins define MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the plugin root or inline in `plugin.json`
*   When a plugin is enabled, its MCP servers start automatically
*   Plugin MCP tools appear alongside manually configured MCP tools
*   Plugin servers are managed through plugin installation (not `/mcp` commands)

**Example plugin MCP configuration**:In `.mcp.json` at plugin root:

```
{
  "database-tools": {
    "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
    "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
    "env": {
      "DB_URL": "${DB_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

Or inline in `plugin.json`:

```
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-api": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/api-server",
      "args": ["--port", "8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Plugin MCP features**:

*   **Automatic lifecycle**: Servers start when plugin enables, but you must restart Claude Code to apply MCP server changes (enabling or disabling)
*   **Environment variables**: Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths
*   **User environment access**: Access to same environment variables as manually configured servers
*   **Multiple transport types**: Support stdio, SSE, and HTTP transports (transport support may vary by server)

**Viewing plugin MCP servers**:

```
# Within Claude Code, see all MCP servers including plugin ones
/mcp
```

Plugin servers appear in the list with indicators showing they come from plugins.**Benefits of plugin MCP servers**:

*   **Bundled distribution**: Tools and servers packaged together
*   **Automatic setup**: No manual MCP configuration needed
*   **Team consistency**: Everyone gets the same tools when plugin is installed

See the [plugin components reference](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins-reference#mcp-servers) for details on bundling MCP servers with plugins.

MCP installation scopes
-----------------------

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn’t be shared.

```
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add --transport http stripe --scope local https://mcp.stripe.com
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project’s root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add --transport http paypal --scope project https://mcp.paypal.com/mcp
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```
# Add a user server
claude mcp add --transport http hubspot --scope user https://mcp.hubspot.com/anthropic
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

*   **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
*   **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
*   **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json`

Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json` files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.**Supported syntax:**

*   `${VAR}` - Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR`
*   `${VAR:-default}` - Expands to `VAR` if set, otherwise uses `default`

**Expansion locations:** Environment variables can be expanded in:

*   `command` - The server executable path
*   `args` - Command-line arguments
*   `env` - Environment variables passed to the server
*   `url` - For HTTP server types
*   `headers` - For HTTP server authentication

**Example with variable expansion:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${API_BASE_URL:-https://api.example.com}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

Practical examples
------------------

### Example: Monitor errors with Sentry

```
# 1. Add the Sentry MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# 2. Use /mcp to authenticate with your Sentry account
> /mcp

# 3. Debug production issues
> "What are the most common errors in the last 24 hours?"
> "Show me the stack trace for error ID abc123"
> "Which deployment introduced these new errors?"
```

### Example: Connect to GitHub for code reviews

```
# 1. Add the GitHub MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/

# 2. In Claude Code, authenticate if needed
> /mcp
# Select "Authenticate" for GitHub

# 3. Now you can ask Claude to work with GitHub
> "Review PR #456 and suggest improvements"
> "Create a new issue for the bug we just found"
> "Show me all open PRs assigned to me"
```

### Example: Query your PostgreSQL database

```
# 1. Add the database server with your connection string
claude mcp add --transport stdio db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub \
  --dsn "postgresql://readonly:[email protected]:5432/analytics"

# 2. Query your database naturally
> "What's our total revenue this month?"
> "Show me the schema for the orders table"
> "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in 90 days"
```

Authenticate with remote MCP servers
------------------------------------

Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

Use Claude Code as an MCP server
--------------------------------

You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:

```
# Start Claude as a stdio MCP server
claude mcp serve
```

You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude_desktop_config.json:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

MCP output limits and warnings
------------------------------

When MCP tools produce large outputs, Claude Code helps manage the token usage to prevent overwhelming your conversation context:

*   **Output warning threshold**: Claude Code displays a warning when any MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens
*   **Configurable limit**: You can adjust the maximum allowed MCP output tokens using the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable
*   **Default limit**: The default maximum is 25,000 tokens

To increase the limit for tools that produce large outputs:

```
# Set a higher limit for MCP tool outputs
export MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000
claude
```

This is particularly useful when working with MCP servers that:

*   Query large datasets or databases
*   Generate detailed reports or documentation
*   Process extensive log files or debugging information

Use MCP resources
-----------------

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

Enterprise MCP configuration
----------------------------

For organizations that need centralized control over MCP servers, Claude Code supports enterprise-managed MCP configurations. This allows IT administrators to:

*   **Control which MCP servers employees can access**: Deploy a standardized set of approved MCP servers across the organization
*   **Prevent unauthorized MCP servers**: Optionally restrict users from adding their own MCP servers
*   **Disable MCP entirely**: Remove MCP functionality completely if needed

### Setting up enterprise MCP configuration

System administrators can deploy an enterprise MCP configuration file alongside the managed settings file:

*   **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json`
*   **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json`
*   **Linux**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json`

The `managed-mcp.json` file uses the same format as a standard `.mcp.json` file:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    },
    "sentry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"
    },
    "company-internal": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/company-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--config", "/etc/company/mcp-config.json"],
      "env": {
        "COMPANY_API_URL": "https://internal.company.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
