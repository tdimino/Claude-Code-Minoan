In our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve the user experience, we have now implemented standardized error codes for any failures or issues encountered during Brand registration. These error codes will be directly available through the errors attribute on the Brand.   With this release, it’s important to note that brand_feedback and failure_reason will be deprecated in an upcoming release. We understand that changes in API attributes can impact your existing integrations. If you have used these attributes in your integrations, we strongly advise transitioning to the new 'errors' attribute due to its pending deprecation and limited information.   For a detailed overview of the new error codes, their possible causes, and solutions, please refer to our updated Brand registration Twilio docs for Sole Prop and Low Volume Standard/Standard.

This enables you to keep all email event data such as opens, clicks, bounces, and unsubscribes, and email recipient emails within the EU, giving you control over where your customer data lives. This is important as email event data, which includes recipient email addresses and engagement history data is considered personally identifiable information.   Before, when you sent an email through Twilio SendGrid, it was handled by our global API. That meant your email and the data it generates is processed through our global infrastructure and stored in data centers around the world.  With Data Residency for Email (EU), the flow is different. Emails sent through the EU API are processed within the EU region, and recipient personal data and email event data is stored in EU-based systems. This gives businesses more control over where their data is stored and helps meet regional compliance standards without compromising performance or deliverability.

With virtual numbers powered by an API, complex software workflows can be built that are triggered by calls and texts.
* [What is UTF-8?](/docs/glossary/what-utf-8.md): UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding standard that uses between one and four eight-bit bytes to represent all valid Unicode code points.
* [What is an SMS tracker?](/docs/glossary/what-sms-tracker.md): An SMS tracker is software that uncovers detailed information about the delivery and content of text and picture messages. It allows anyone to analyze an individual message or group of messages to see delivery patterns, encoding details, and error conditions.
   
* [Messaging Character Limits](/docs/glossary/what-sms-character-limit.md): A single SMS message technically supports up to 160 characters, or up to 70 if the message contains one or more Unicode characters (such as emoji or Chinese characters).
  However, modern phones and mobile networks support message concatenation, which enables longer messages to be sent. Messages longer than 160 characters are automatically split into parts (called "segments") and then re-assembled when they are received. Message concatenation allows you to send long SMS messages, but this increases your per-message cost, because SMS are billed per segment.
  The 160-character limit is for messages encoded using the GSM-7 character set. Messages not encoded with GSM-7 are limited to 70 characters. For detail on how these character limits change on concatenated (multi-segment) messages, see below.
  Twilio's platform supports long messages up to 1600 characters across all Programmable Messaging channels, including SMS and RCS. However, for SMS messaging, Twilio recommends sending messages that are no more than 320 characters to ensure the best deliverability and user experience. &#x20;
  RCS supports a more size-efficient character encoding scheme called UTF-8.  With UTF-8, Unicode characters are natively supported and take up less character-length space that would otherwise lead to higher segment counts over SMS.
* [What is a Long Code?](/docs/glossary/what-long-code-phone-number.md): A long code number is a standard phone number used to send and receive voice calls and SMS messages. Phone numbers are typically called "long codes" (10-digit numbers in many countries) when comparing them with SMS short codes (5-6 digit numbers).
* [What is VoIP (Voice Over IP)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-voip.md): Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a category of hardware and software that enables voice calls to be made and received over the internet.
* [What is a Voice API?](/docs/glossary/what-is-voice-api.md): A PSTN) and applications connected to the internet. By using a voice API, software developers can program voice calling into their applications without specialized telecommunications knowledge and hardware.
* [What is Unicode?](/docs/glossary/what-is-unicode.md): Unicode is an international character encoding standard that provides a unique number for every character across languages and scripts, making almost all characters accessible across platforms, programs, and devices.
* [What is UCS-2 Character Encoding?](/docs/glossary/what-is-ucs-2-character-encoding.md): UCS-2 is a character encoding standard in which characters are represented by a fixed-length 16 bits (2 bytes).  It is used as a fallback on many GSM networks when a message cannot be encoded using GSM-7 or when a language requires more than 128 characters to be rendered.
* [What is Two Factor Authentication?](/docs/glossary/what-is-two-factor-authentication-2fa.md): Two-factor authentication (commonly abbreviated 2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your user's account login by requiring two types of authentication. This is usually something your user knows and something they have.
* [What is the Twilio Markup Language (TwiML)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-twilio-markup-language-twiml.md): TwiML, or the Twilio Markup Language, is an XML based language which instructs Twilio on how to handle various events such as incoming and outgoing calls, SMS messages and MMS messages.  When building a Twilio application you will use TwiML when communicating your desired actions to Twilio.
* [What is Toll Fraud?](/docs/glossary/what-is-toll-fraud.md): Toll fraud, also known as International Revenue Sharing Fraud (IRSF), happens when an application is exploited to generate a high volume of voice calls to the fraudster's own international premium rate numbers. The victim of the toll fraud bears the entire financial responsibility for each minute of the call.
* [What is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-telephone-consumer-protection-act-tcpa.md): The TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) is a federal statute enacted in 1991 designed to safeguard consumer privacy. This legislation restricts telemarketing communications via voice calls, SMS texts, and fax.
* [What is SMS Pumping Fraud?](/docs/glossary/what-is-sms-pumping-fraud.md): SMS pumping fraud happens when fraudsters take advantage of a phone number input field to receive a one-time passcode, an app download link, or anything else via SMS. The messages are sent to a range of numbers controlled by a specific mobile network operator (MNO) and the fraudsters get a share of the generated revenue. 
* [What is SMS Delivery or Deliverability?](/docs/glossary/what-is-sms-delivery-deliverability.md): SMS Delivery is a measure of the percentage of outgoing SMS and MMS messages which are received at their intended destination.  While sometimes referring to the status of a single message, SMS delivery usually is a rate of delivered versus intended messages and summarized as an 'SMS Delivery Rate.'
* [What is an SMS API?](/docs/glossary/what-is-sms-api-short-messaging-service.md): A SMS API is well-defined software interface which enables code to send SMS Gateway.
  As the infrastructures for SMS communications and the internet are mostly divided, SMS APIs are often used to 'bridge the gap' between telecommunications carrier networks and the wider web.  SMS APIs are used to allow web applications to send and receive text messages through logic written for standard web frameworks.
* [What is SIP Trunking?](/docs/glossary/what-is-sip-trunking.md): What is SIP Calling?
  SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking refers to phone calls that are routed over the Internet rather than traditional phone lines. SIP calling, therefore, refers to the act of placing calls via a SIP trunk. Because SIP calls take place across the Internet, they tend to be cheaper and more efficient than calls placed through traditional phone systems.
  Physical connections to a phone company are eliminated with the use of a SIP trunk. Using SIP trunks, a SIP provider can connect multiple channels to your private branch exchange (Voice-over-IP (VoIP) infrastructure.
* [What is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-session-initiation-protocol-sip.md): Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signalling protocol for initiating, terminating, and modifying user sessions over an IP network.  Most commonly, SIP is used for Voice Over IP (VoIP) services, but is also often used for other communications sessions such as video calls and instant messaging sessions.
* [What is a Push Notification?](/docs/glossary/what-is-push-notification.md): A push notification (also known as a server push notification) is the delivery of information to a computing device from an application server where the request for the transaction is initiated by the server rather than by an explicit request from the client. While 'push notification' is most often used to refer to notifications on mobile devices, web applications also leverage this technology.
* [What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information-pii.md): Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or personal data, is data that corresponds to a single person. PII might be a phone number, national ID number, email address, or any data that can be used, either on its own or with any other information, to contact, identify, or locate a person.
* [What is a Private Branch Exchange (PBX)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-pbx-private-branch-exchange.md): PBX, short for Private Branch Exchange, is a phone system in an enterprise that manages incoming and outgoing phone calls as well as an organization's internal communications.
* [What is an MMS?](/docs/glossary/what-is-mms.md): MMS, short for Multimedia Messaging Service, is a standard way to send multimedia such as pictures, videos, and other attachments over text messaging channels.
